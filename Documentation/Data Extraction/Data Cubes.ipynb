        "# Accessing Data Cubes\n",
        "\n",
        "At the core of a lot of Rocky Brands research is reliance on the old sales cube methods for data aggregation. This setup requires at least familiarity with the MDX language, the use of some python libraries for interacting with the ADOMD client, and a few more steps that are generally unpalatable. This post will go into how to get programmatic access to this MS proprietary tool in R, and cover the basics of the package [lehighCube](https://github.com/lehighkent/lehighCube) developed to ease the process. \n",
        "\n",
        "## System Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll have to do this on a Windows machine unfortunately, as you'll need some of the MS drivers installed to interact with the drivers. Your first requirements are the ADOMD and MSOLAPx86 drivers. You can find those [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/client-libraries?view=asallproducts-allversions). Additionally you'll need to use the python library [Pyadomd](https://github.com/S-C-O-U-T/Pyadomd). \n",

        "## Python Virtual Env\n",
        "\n",
        "To make a cube connection, it's recommended that a project calling such get its own venv to call with. You absolutely can make a global venv for this tool, but for the sake of the author, I just create a new environment to contain each project. If you go thr route of the `lehighCube` package, you can simply call `lehighCube::py_env()` and follow the prompts. Otherwise, assuming RStudio you'll want to go through the reticulate route. I will simply copy and paste the `py_env` source below as it should be a comprehensive guide to setting up a project folder. \n",

        "\n",
        "MDX is cool for what is does, but a pain in the ass for what it doesn't. The worst part is that Microsoft wants you to pay them to learn how to use the tool they built that you pay them to use, so documentation is sparse. In addition it's an old technology that has largely fallen out of favor for analytics so the forum posts and the like tend to be very old. If you run into a real problem, I suggest opening Excel and using PowerQuery to build the MDX string, then editing from there. \n",
